    "# Instructions:\n",
    "- Read the file Advertising.csv as a dataframe.\n",
    "- Fix a budget amount of 1000 dollars for TV advertising as variable called Budget\n",
    "- Select the number of bootstraps.\n",
    "- For each bootstrap:\n",
    "    - Select a new dataframe with the predictor as TV and the response as Sales.\n",
    "    - Fit a simple linear regression on the data.\n",
    "    - Predict on the budget and compute the error estimate using the helper function `error_func()`\n",
    "    - Store the `sales` as a sum of the prediction and the error estimate and append to `sales_dist`\n",
    "- Sort the `sales_dist which is a distribution of predicted sales over `numboot` bootstraps.\n",
    "- Compute the 95% confidence interval of sales_dist\n",
    "- Use the helper function `plot_simulation` to visualize the distribution and print the estimated sales.\n",

    "Your sales prediction is based on the Simple-Linear regression model between `TV` and `Sales`.\n",
    "Now, re-run the above exercise but this time fit the model considering all variables in `Advertising.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the budget the same, i.e $1000 for 'TV' advertising. \n",
    "You may have to change the `budget` variable to something like `[[1000,0,0]]` for proper computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does your predicted sales interval change?\n",
    "Why, or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**For budget [1000], the answer:**\n",
    "*we can expect an increase of sales anywhere between 46.45 to 62.60 with a 95% confidence interval*\n",
    "\n",
    "**For budget [1000, 0, 0], the answer:**\n",
    "*we can expect an increase of sales anywhere between 43.80 to 53.51 with a 95% confidence interval*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted sales interval is likely to change when you consider all variables in the Advertising.csv dataset compared to the Simple Linear Regression model with only TV as a predictor.\n",
    "This is because the inclusion of additional variables may affect the relationship between the predictors and the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of your specific question, it appears that you are using a multiple linear regression model where the predictors include not only TV but also other variables, potentially represented by the vector [1000, 0, 0]. This means that the budget is allocated not only to TV advertising but also to other advertising channels, and these channels may have an impact on sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in the predicted sales interval reflects the influence of these additional variables. **The wider interval suggests increased uncertainty in the sales prediction due to the presence of other variables. These additional variables introduce more complexity to the model, and their effects on sales may not be as precisely estimated, leading to a broader confidence interval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the change in the predicted sales interval is expected when considering all variables, reflecting the increased complexity and potential uncertainty associated with a multiple linear regression model."
