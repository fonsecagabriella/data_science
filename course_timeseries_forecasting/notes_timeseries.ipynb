    "# Notes - Timeseries forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "üì∫ [Link to the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxx_E0ojKrc)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeseries data**\n",
    "Data that is equally spaced in time / indexed in time, with equal intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality**\n",
    "A pattern that repeats over fixed intervals of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend**\n",
    "General direction of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Residuals**\n",
    "Changes in the pattern not explained by the seasonality and trend, ideally they are random.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **NOTE:** **We can model the seasonality and trend** but not the residuals, so a model is never perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- A good baseline model is very important in forecasting. In this tutorial we use (statsforecast) to create a baseline model. For season data, usually **SeasonalNaive** model is the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical models for forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model\n",
    "- SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA model)\n",
    "- Exponential smoothing\n",
    "- Theta model (decomposition approach)\n",
    "- MSTL, BATS, TBATS (multiple seasonal periods)\n",
    "- Croston, IMAPA, TSB (intermittent series - data with zero and non-zero values)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ARIMA**\n",
    "With ARIMA you can model and forecast any series with a trend and one seasonal period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ARL** / ***autoregressive model***: future values of the series depend on past values. Denoted as AR(p).\n",
    "- **MA** /  ***moving average model***: Future values depend on the present and past error terms; the errors are independent and normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecasting with exogenous features\n",
    "\n",
    "External features that are no part of the timeseries itself (holidays, temperature outside, wind speed, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**\n",
    "- static (stays constant in time, like a product category)\n",
    "- historical (we know the value in the past but not in the future, like price of gas)\n",
    "- future features (values that known both in past and future, like holidays)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create exogenous features** \n",
    "- Use Fourier terms for seasonality\n",
    "- Enconde timestamp as features (code then, like mondays = day 1, which will repeat every week)\n",
    "\n",
    "***‚ÄºÔ∏è NOTE: Not all models support exogenous features, but ARIMA/SARIMA does.***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "- A point forecast does not consider the uncertainty of the future. \n",
    "- Stochastic models generate uncertainty automatically following the normal distribution (ARIMA is a a stochastic model)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point Forecast**\n",
    "MAE, MSE, RMSE, sMAPE, MASE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic**\n",
    "CRPS"
