# Types of Scalers and When to Use Them
The choice of scaler depends on the characteristics of your data and the specific requirements of the machine learning model you're using. Hereâ€™s a brief guide on different types of scalers and when to use them:

## StandardScaler
**Description:** Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
**Use Case:**
When your data follows a Gaussian distribution (normal distribution).
When using models that assume normally distributed data, like linear models and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## MinMaxScaler
**Description:** Scales features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].
**Use Case:**
When you want to preserve the relationships between values in terms of their proportional spacing.
Useful for algorithms sensitive to the magnitude of the values, such as neural networks.

## RobustScaler
**Description:**  Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers, such as the median and the interquartile range.
**Use Case:**
When your data contains outliers.
Useful for models where outliers can distort the scaling, like regression models.

## MaxAbsScaler
**Description:**  Scales each feature by its maximum absolute value.
**Use Case:**
When dealing with data that contains negative values and needs to be scaled to the range [-1, 1].
Suitable for sparse data.


## Normalizer
**Description:**  Normalizes samples individually to unit norm.
**Use Case:**
When you need to scale each individual sample to have unit norm.
Often used in text processing or other applications where feature vectors are typically sparse and have different magnitudes.


# Summary
**StandardScaler:** Use for Gaussian-like data.
**MinMaxScaler:** Use for non-Gaussian data, when preserving data distribution proportionally.
**RobustScaler:** Use for data with outliers.
**MaxAbsScaler:** Use for data with both positive and negative values.
**Normalizer:** Use when normalizing each sample to unit norm is necessary.

Recommendation: For most cases in machine learning, especially when using models like SVM, linear regression, or neural networks, StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler are good starting points. If your data has many outliers, consider using RobustScaler.
