    "\n",
    "-- If all models can estimate class probability, then you can set *voting=soft*. This often performs better because it gives more weight to confident scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Another way to ensemble models is to train the same model with different samples from you training data. Here we have *bagging (bootstrap aggregating, with replacament)* and *pasting (without replacement)*\n",
