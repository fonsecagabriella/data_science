# ML PROJECTS STEPS

1. Look at the big picture
How is the company going to use the output from your model?
In which part of the pipeline does it fit?
What does the current solution look like? **Good to understand metrics**
Do you have a classification of a regression problem?

**Select the performance measure**

2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualise the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for ML algorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system
