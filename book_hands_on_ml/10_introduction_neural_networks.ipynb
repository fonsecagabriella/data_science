    "In essence: For each epoch, for each training instance the backpropagation algorithm first makes a prediction (forward pass), measures the error, then goes through each layer in reverse to measure the error con‐ tribution from each connection (reverse pass), and finally slightly tweaks the connec‐ tion weights to reduce the error (Gradient Descent step)."
