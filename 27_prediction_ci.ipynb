    "# Instructions:\n",
    "- Read the file Advertising.csv as a dataframe.\n",
    "- Fix a budget amount of 1000 dollars for TV advertising as variable called Budget\n",
    "- Select the number of bootstraps.\n",
    "- For each bootstrap:\n",
    "    - Select a new dataframe with the predictor as TV and the response as Sales.\n",
    "    - Fit a simple linear regression on the data.\n",
    "    - Predict on the budget and compute the error estimate using the helper function `error_func()`\n",
    "    - Store the `sales` as a sum of the prediction and the error estimate and append to `sales_dist`\n",
    "- Sort the `sales_dist which is a distribution of predicted sales over `numboot` bootstraps.\n",
    "- Compute the 95% confidence interval of sales_dist\n",
    "- Use the helper function `plot_simulation` to visualize the distribution and print the estimated sales.\n",
