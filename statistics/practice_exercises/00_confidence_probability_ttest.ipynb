    "## ðŸš— Problem: COâ‚‚ Emissions & Car Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You're analyzing data from a recent survey of fuel consumption and COâ‚‚ emissions of cars from different brands. You randomly select 50 cars from the dataset and compute the following (summary statistics are fictional for practice):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample size: 50\n",
    "- Mean COâ‚‚ emission: 250 g/km\n",
    "- Standard deviation of COâ‚‚ emissions: 40 g/km\n",
    "- Sample mean fuel consumption (L/100km): 8.2\n",
    "- Standard deviation of fuel consumption: 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "A regulation agency claims that the average COâ‚‚ emission for this category of cars should be no more than 240 g/km.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ”¢ Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Using a 5% significance level, test the claim made by the regulation agency about COâ‚‚ emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses.**\n",
    "H0: u = 240\n",
    "H1: u > 240\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Compute the relevant test statistic and determine whether to reject the null.**\n",
    "I can apply the z-score, since n>30\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (observed mean - claimed mean) / (std/sqrt(n) )\n",
    "z = 250 - 240 / 40 / V(50)\n",
    "\n",
    "z = 1,76\n",
    "\n",
    "For a significance level of 5%, one-tailed test, the critical value is z(0.05)=1.645.\n",
    "As z falls inside the rejection area, so I can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Whatâ€™s the p-value and how would you interpret it?**\n",
    "This is the cummulative probability from the left, so we do 1 - P(z).\n",
    "\n",
    "p-value=P(Z>1.7678) = 1âˆ’P(Z<1.7678 )= 1âˆ’0.9611= 0.0389\n",
    "\n",
    "p-value=0.0389 < 0.05     â‡’    RejectÂ H0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Interpretation: At 5% significance, thereâ€™s enough evidence to say that the true average COâ‚‚ emissions may be higher than 240 g/km.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sample mean of 250 is somewhat unlikely (p = 0.039) if the true average is really 240. That gives us evidence to doubt the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the true mean COâ‚‚ emission is 240, the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 250 or more (i.e., as extreme or more extreme) is approximately 3.9%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Confidence Interval\n",
    "Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average COâ‚‚ emission of these cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of error: z(1-alpha/2) * std / sqrt(n)\n",
    "So for alpha=0.05, z(0.975)=1.96\n",
    "\n",
    "1.96 * 40 / sqrt(50) = 11,08\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is 238,91 and 261,08.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Based on your interval, does the agencyâ€™s target of 240 g/km seem plausible?**\n",
    "It's plausible, although it's very close to the lower bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Probability\n",
    "Assuming COâ‚‚ emissions follow a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Whatâ€™s the probability that a randomly selected car emits more than 280 g/km?**\n",
    "1. Compute the z-score\n",
    "    z= 280 - 250 / 40 = 0.75\n",
    "2. Look for p(z)\n",
    "    P(Z<0.75) = 0.7734\n",
    "\n",
    "Then P(z>0.75) = 1 - 0.7734 = 0.2266\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Final answer:\n",
    "Thereâ€™s a 22.66% chance that a randomly selected car emits more than 280 g/km.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Whatâ€™s the probability that a car emits between 230 and 270 g/km?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute both z scores\n",
    "    - For 230, z1 = (230-250)/ 40 = âˆ’0.5\n",
    "    - For 270, z2 = (270 - 250) / 40 = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look for p(z)\n",
    "    - P(z < 0.5) = 0.6915\n",
    "    - P(z < -0.5) = 0.3085\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Subtracht to get the area in between\n",
    "    - P(230 < X < 270) = 0.6915âˆ’0.3085 = 0.3830\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Final answer:\n",
    "Thereâ€™s a 38.30% chance that a randomly selected car emits between 230 and 270 g/km.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Bonus: Fuel Efficiency and COâ‚‚\n",
    "Letâ€™s say you also divide the 50 cars into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group A (25 fuel-efficient cars): mean COâ‚‚ = 230 g/km, std dev = 35 g/km\n",
    "\n",
    "Group B (25 standard cars): mean COâ‚‚ = 270 g/km, std dev = 30 g/km\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to test whether the average COâ‚‚ emissions of Group A and B differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. What kind of test would you use here?**\n",
    "Independent two-sample t-test (because youâ€™re comparing the means of two independent groups with known sample statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. State the null and alternative hypotheses.**\n",
    "H0 u(group a) = u(group b); H1 u(group a) <> u(group b)\n",

    "Sample standard deviation: 5 km\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "You want to test the companyâ€™s claim at a 5% significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. State the null and alternative hypotheses.**\n",

    "If the true mean was really 32 km, there's only 2% of chance of observing the results I had.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Confidence Interval\n",
    "Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average battery life.\n",
    "**a. Does the confidence interval support the companyâ€™s claim?**\n",
    "\n",
    "z(1-alpha/2) * std/sqrt(n) = 1.96 * 0.6454 = 1.265\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is 29.23 - 31.76.\n",
    "Thefore there is not evidence to support the company's claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Probability\n",
    "Assume the battery life follows a normal distribution with a mean of 30.5 km and a standard deviation of 5 km (from the sample).\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. What is the probability that a randomly chosen scooter lasts more than 35 km?**\n",
    "First calculate the z-value of 35:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (35 - 30.5) / 5  = 0.9\n",

    "From: https://datatab.net/tutorial/z-distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Most online calculators will give you directly: P(z<0.9) = 0.18406\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a probability of about 63% that a randomly choosen scooter will last more than 35km.\n",

    "**b. Whatâ€™s the probability that a scooter lasts between 28 km and 33 km?**\n",

    "\n",
    "P(28<x<33) = 0.6915 - 0.3085 = 0.383\n",
