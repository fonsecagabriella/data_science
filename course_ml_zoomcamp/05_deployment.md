# Deployment

- **Train and Save the Model:** After training the model, save it as a file, to use it for making predictions in future.
- **Create API Endpoints:** Make the API endpoints in order to request predictions. It is possible to use the Flask framework to create web service API endpoints that other services can interact with.
- **Some other server deployment options**
    -- **Pipenv:** Create isolated environments to manage the Python dependencies of the web service, ensuring they don‚Äôt interfere with other services on the machine.
    -- **Docker:** Package the service in a Docker container, which includes both system and Python dependencies, making it easier to deploy consistently across different environments.
- **Deploy to the Cloud:** Finally, deploy the Docker container to a cloud service like AWS to make the model accessible globally, ensuring scalability and reliability.


## 1.0 Saving and Loading the Model

- After you trained the model in your jupiter notebook, `import pickle` to save the model.
- Download your jupiter notebook as `python .py`, and format it a little bit, remove what you don't need
- The file you downloaded is your python script you can use.

```py
# save the model
import pickle
output_file = 'file.bin'

with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
    pickle.dump((dv, model), f_out)
    #'wb' is for 'write binary'

# load the model
with open(output_file, 'rb') as f_in:
    dv, model = pickle.load(f_in)
    # 'rb' is for 'read binary'

```




## 2.0 Web Service  

**Web service**:  A service that communicates via a network. You send a request (ping), get a treated output (pong)
 
- Here we create a `Flask Web Service`, named `ping.py` in the `code_deployment` folder. 
- `curl` requests a webservice

````
curl http://0.0.0.0:9696/ping
````

## 3.0 Serving the churn model with Flask

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª [Code of this lesson](./code_deployment/)
- Run `ping.py` from the folder above; When you go to the browser, and type `http://192.168.2.10:9696/ping` you will get `pong` as a response



## 4.0 Pipenv

- Install pipenv
- Run `pipenv install numpy pandas scikit-learn==0.24.2 flask gunicorn` to install the packages in the virtual machine
- It will create two files: `pipenv` and `pipfile.lock`
- `pipenv shell` runs the virtual environment
- `pipenv run gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app` : Run on the folder where the files are
