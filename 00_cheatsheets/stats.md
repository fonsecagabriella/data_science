# Stats

## Types of features
- scale (numerical)
- categorical
- nominal 

## confidence interval for mean
x +/- z * stddev/sqrt(n)

## confidence interval for proportions
p +/- z * sqrt( (p*(1-p)) / n  )


## standardization - Z-score
z = X-u / stddev (or o)

**Standard Error**
SE = σ / √n,
(you use SE for z-score if population mean is unknown)


## Effect size
- Always report on effect size

## Which test to perform
z-test or t-test

## How to reject null
- p < alpha
- confidence interval has no zero

-> We never accept the null hypothesis, we fail to reject it
