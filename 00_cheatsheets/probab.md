# Probability


## Addition rule
P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)

if A and B are mutually exclusive.

## Multiplication rule

P(A and B)=P(A)×P(B)

if the events and independent

## Conditional probability

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

## The Binomial Formula

 X ~ B(n, p)

When you repeat an experiment 𝑛 times (like coin flips), and each trial has:

 - probability of success = p
- probability of failure = 1−p

The probability of getting exactly k successes is:

𝑃(exactly 𝑘 successes ) = ( n k) * [ p ^(k) ] * [(1-p) ^(n-k)] 

(n k) = n! / [k! (n-k)!]


- Mean: u = n*p
- Variance o^2 = n x p (1-p)
