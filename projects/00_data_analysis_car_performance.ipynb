    "# ðŸš— Problem: COâ‚‚ Emissions & Car Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You're analyzing data from a recent survey of fuel consumption and COâ‚‚ emissions of cars from different brands. You randomly select 50 cars from the dataset and compute the following (summary statistics are fictional for practice):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample size: 50\n",
    "- Mean COâ‚‚ emission: 250 g/km\n",
    "- Standard deviation of COâ‚‚ emissions: 40 g/km\n",
    "- Sample mean fuel consumption (L/100km): 8.2\n",
    "- Standard deviation of fuel consumption: 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "A regulation agency claims that the average COâ‚‚ emission for this category of cars should be no more than 240 g/km.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ”¢ Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Using a 5% significance level, test the claim made by the regulation agency about COâ‚‚ emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Compute the relevant test statistic and determine whether to reject the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Whatâ€™s the p-value and how would you interpret it?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Confidence Interval\n",
    "Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average COâ‚‚ emission of these cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Based on your interval, does the agencyâ€™s target of 240 g/km seem plausible?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Probability\n",
    "Assuming COâ‚‚ emissions follow a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Whatâ€™s the probability that a randomly selected car emits more than 280 g/km?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Whatâ€™s the probability that a car emits between 230 and 270 g/km?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Bonus: Fuel Efficiency and COâ‚‚\n",
    "Letâ€™s say you also divide the 50 cars into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group A (25 fuel-efficient cars): mean COâ‚‚ = 230 g/km, std dev = 35 g/km\n",
    "\n",
    "Group B (25 standard cars): mean COâ‚‚ = 270 g/km, std dev = 30 g/km\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to test whether the average COâ‚‚ emissions of Group A and B differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. What kind of test would you use here?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Would the difference be considered statistically significant at a 0.05 level?"
